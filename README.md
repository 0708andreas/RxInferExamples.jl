# RxInferExamples.jl

This repository contains several examples using [RxInfer.jl](rxinfer.ml).

## List of examples:
- **Drone demo** (by @bvdmitri and @bartvanerp) - Have you always wanted to fly a drone? Check out this cool example with simplified mechanics.

Examples from the documentation of [RxInfer.jl](rxinfer.ml) will be ported in the future.


## Installation instructions
The current example is based on the upcoming release of [RxInfer.jl](rxinfer.ml), which includes a complete overhaul of GraphPPL.jl. In order to get the demo up just call `make install` from the root of this directory. You should have [Julia](julialang.org) installed as a prerequisite.
